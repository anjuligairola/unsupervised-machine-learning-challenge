# unsupervised-machine-learning-challenge
## Summary 
* The PCA method preserve 90% of the explained variance in dimensionality reduction. It reduced the features from 14 to 3. 
* The visualization generated through t-SNE do not show distinct clusters.
* The clustering was also performed using K-means. After performing dimensionality reduction with PCA,K-means of first two principa components showed that the patients can be clustered into three groups.
